Gatech CS2340 Project for Movie recommendation app
      Qixuan Hou, Alex Wu, Ryang Phan, Zhijian Chen, and I (Joon Gyu Choi)
      built a basic mobile application. 
      
      This app basically works to show movie information 
      and referral sites for Georgia Tech students. 
      To support the site, we accessed a set of 
      REST services from Open Movie DB (http://www.omdbapi.com/).
      
      This application allows students to share 
      private recommendations and comments about 
      movies they have seen, and to rank movies.
      Also, the Movie rankings can be reported overall, or by student major.
